In this repo, you'll find relevant resources about APIs to access Beatoven.ai's composition capabilities.

If you are interested in using the API, please get in touch with hello@beatoven.ai. We would like to discuss your use-case(s) and issue an API key for your application.

Once you have an API key, you can refer to the [API spec](docs/api-spec.md) and start playing around with the API.

If you need any help, please reach out.
