In this repo, you'll find relevant resources about APIs to access Beatoven.ai's composition capabilities.

If you are interested in using the API, you can generate the key by signing up [here](https://sync.beatoven.ai/apiDashboard). In case you'd like to talk to us regarding the API, please write to us on hello@beatoven.ai

If you are interested in using the API, please get in touch with hello@beatoven.ai. We would like to discuss your use-case(s) and issue an API key for your application.

Once you have an API key, you can refer to the [API spec](docs/api-spec.md) and start playing around with the API.

You can also find a very basic example of a python script that creates and composes a track [here](examples/compose.py).

If you need any help, please reach out.
